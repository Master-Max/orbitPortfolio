This is the repo for my threejs portfolio

to launch on localhost use:

npx vite --host



To update site on github run:

1. npm run build
	- builds a static version of the site in /dist
2. npm run serve
	- makes a test version of the static website on localhost:5000
3. npm run deploy
	- pushes the website to the git-pages branch of the repository
